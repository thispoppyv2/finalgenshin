            New Areas in Liyue Now Available

            ◇ New Areas: In Version 4.4, the following areas in Liyue will become available: Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale,
            Chenyu Vale: Southern Mountain, and Mt. Laixin.


            ※ As long as you have completed Archon Quest Prologue: Act III "Song of the Dragon and Freedom," a Teleport
            Waypoint will be automatically unlocked near Liyue's Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale (If you have already completed
            this Archon Quest, the Teleport Waypoint will be unlocked after the update). You'll also receive the
            Primogem reward for this Teleport Waypoint when it unlocks automatically.


            New System in Liyue

            Rainjade Oblation

            Fujin's adeptal energy has transformed into many Spirit Carp that are scattered all over Chenyu Vale.
            Collect the energy within Spirit Carp and transfer it into the Votive Rainjade within Carp's Rest to
            increase its level and obtain the blessings of Chenyu Vale.

            Rainjade Oblation System Unlock Criteria:

            • Complete the World Quest "The Cloud-Padded Path to the Chiwang Repose"


            In addition, there will be new Fishing Points and "Radiant Spincrystals" in Liyue.


            II. New Characters

            5-Star Character "Passerine Herald" Xianyun (Anemo)

            ◇ Vision: Anemo

            ◇ Weapon: Catalyst

            ◇ One of the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti of Jueyun, known as "Cloud Retainer." Expert in all kinds of
            mechanical contraptions, her heart now turns towards the affairs of the mortal world, through which she
            walks under the name "Xianyun."

            ◆ Elemental Skill "White Clouds at Dawn"

            ◆ Xianyun enters the Cloud Transmogrification state, in which she will not take Fall DMG, and uses Skyladder
            once. In this state, Xianyun can cast Skyladder continuously to leap, where her Plunging Attack will be
            converted into an even stronger Driftcloud Wave instead, which deals AoE Anemo DMG. The more times Skyladder
            is used, the more DMG the resulting Driftcloud Wave will deal and the larger its AoE.

            ◆ Elemental Burst "Stars Gather at Dusk"

            ◆ Brings forth a sacred breeze that deals AoE Anemo DMG and heals all nearby characters. It will also summon
            the "Starwicker" mechanism that follows the active character and periodically heals all nearby party
            members. When the Starwicker has Adeptal Assistance stacks, characters will have their jump height
            increased. When they complete a Plunging Attack, Adeptal Assistance stacks will be consumed and deal AoE
            Anemo DMG.


            4-Star Character "Leonine Vanguard" Gaming (Pyro)
