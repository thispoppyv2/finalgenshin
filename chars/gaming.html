    <div class="charstory">
        Yip Gaming (Cantonese: 叶嘉明) is a playable Pyro character in Genshin Impact.

        Born in Qiaoying Village, Gaming left his birthplace after an impasse with his father to pursue his passion and become a professional Wushou dancer, training constantly to make the dance popular throughout Teyvat. However, with his dream career turning out to be financially unsustainable, he also took up a job as a guard for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency, primarily escorting goods and people to and from Yilong Wharf. His diligence and friendliness have earned him renown, and he is considered to be the best guard in the agency.

        Gaming is a young and energetic man working for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency. He has a very strong work ethic, eagerly completing whatever his clients may ask of him and will fiercely protect their cargo regardless of the situation. He also enjoys Wushou Dances, something which he practices regularly on a daily basis, wanting to become a professional dancer. This practice has made him nimble and proficient in martial arts, despite the numerous injuries he obtains doing so. As such, he is well-liked by the people of Yilong Wharf, who see him as reliable and optimistic.

        <span>Pounces forward using the Wushou arts, leaping high into the air after coming into contact with a target or surface.
After Gaming has used Bestial Ascent to rise into the air, he will use the especially powerful Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider when performing a Plunging Attack.

Plunging Attack: Charmed Cloudstrider
The DMG from Plunging Attacks caused by Bestial Ascent is converted to Pyro DMG that cannot be overridden by other elemental infusions. Upon landing, Gaming will consume a fixed amount of HP. Gaming's HP cannot be reduced below 10% by this method.
Charmed Cloudstrider DMG is considered Plunging Attack DMG.

        <span>Gaming enters Wushou Stance, briefly applying Pyro to him, recovering a fixed amount of HP, and summons his companion, the Suanni Man Chai, to smash into his target, dealing AoE Pyro DMG.

After bashing its target, Man Chai will roll to a nearby location before moving towards Gaming. When it links up with Gaming, Man Chai will leave the field and reset the CD for Gaming's Elemental Skill, Bestial Ascent.
While Wushou Stance is active, his resistance to interruption is increased, and when Gaming lands with Charmed Cloudstrider attack or completes the forward pounce attack from Bestial Ascent with over 50% HP, he will summon Man Chai again.

Each Gaming can only have 1 Man Chai on the field simultaneously.
This effect will be canceled once Gaming leaves the field.
