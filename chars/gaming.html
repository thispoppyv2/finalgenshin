    <div class="charstory">
        Yip Gaming (Cantonese: 叶嘉明) is a playable Pyro character in Genshin Impact.

        Born in Qiaoying Village, Gaming left his birthplace after an impasse with his father to pursue his passion and become a professional Wushou dancer, training constantly to make the dance popular throughout Teyvat. However, with his dream career turning out to be financially unsustainable, he also took up a job as a guard for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency, primarily escorting goods and people to and from Yilong Wharf. His diligence and friendliness have earned him renown, and he is considered to be the best guard in the agency.

        Gaming is a young and energetic man working for the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency. He has a very strong work ethic, eagerly completing whatever his clients may ask of him and will fiercely protect their cargo regardless of the situation. He also enjoys Wushou Dances, something which he practices regularly on a daily basis, wanting to become a professional dancer. This practice has made him nimble and proficient in martial arts, despite the numerous injuries he obtains doing so. As such, he is well-liked by the people of Yilong Wharf, who see him as reliable and optimistic.

        <span>Normal Attack
Performs up to 4 consecutive strikes.

Charged Attack
Consumes a certain amount of Stamina to unleash a solo dance, dealing Physical DMG to nearby opponents and changing her Arkhe alignment. If Salon Members or Singer of Many Waters summoned by her Elemental Skill "Salon Solitaire" are present, their lineup will switch in response.

Arkhe: Seats Sacred and Secular
At intervals, when Furina's Normal Attacks hit, a Spiritbreath Thorn or a Surging Blade will descend based on her current alignment, dealing Hydro DMG based on her current alignment.
When Furina takes the field, her starting Arkhe will be Ousia.

Plunging Attack
Plunges from mid-air to strike the ground below, damaging opponents along the path and dealing AoE DMG upon impact.

        <span>Invites the guests of the Salon Solitaire to come forth and aid in Furina's performance. Will summon either the Salon Members or the Singer of Many Waters based on Furina's current Arkhe alignment.

Ousia
Foaming bubbles like celebrants shall dance, dealing AoE Hydro DMG based on Furina's Max HP and summoning 3 Salon Members: the Ball Octopus-shaped Gentilhomme Usher, the Bubbly Seahorse-shaped Surintendante Chevalmarin, and the Armored Crab-shaped Mademoiselle Crabaletta.
They will attack nearby opponents at intervals, prioritizing the target of the active character, dealing Hydro DMG based on Max HP.
When they attack, if character(s) with more than 50% HP are nearby, the Members will increase their current attack's power based on the number of such characters, and consume said characters' HP. If the characters who meet these requirements are 1/2/3/4 (or more), the Members' attacks will deal 110%/120%/130%/140% of their original DMG.

Pneuma
Summons the Singer of Many Waters, who will heal nearby active character(s) based on Max HP at intervals.

The Salon Members and Singer of Many Waters share a duration, and when Furina uses her Charged Attack to change the guest type, the new guests will inherit the initial duration.
While the Salon Members and the Singer of Many Waters are on the field, Furina can move on the water's surface.

        <span>Rouses the impulse to revel, creating a stage of foam that will deal AoE Hydro DMG based on Furina's Max HP and cause nearby party members to enter the Universal Revelry state: During this time, when nearby party members' HP increases or decreases, 1 Fanfare point will be granted to Furina for each percentage point of their Max HP by which their HP changes.

At the same time, Furina will increase the DMG dealt by and Incoming Healing Bonus of all nearby party members based on the amount of Fanfare she has.
When the duration ends, Furina's Fanfare points will be cleared.
