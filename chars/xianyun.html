    <div class="charstory">
        Xianyun (Chinese: 闲云 Xiányún), also known by her adeptus name Cloud Retainer, is a playable Anemo Character in Genshin Impact.

        As an adeptus, Xianyun is devoted to protecting Liyue from external threats and sees Morax in high regard; when she learned of his apparent demise, she flew into a fury and threatened to destroy Liyue Harbor for their crimes, only for the Traveler to placate her by reminding her of her duties. She also has a habit of speaking formally, often addressing herself as "one". In the past, she was revered as a decisive and bold figure, while she was also known by her fellow adepti as solemn and taciturn, rarely speaking outside of activating sigils during battle.
        Having lived for thousands of years, Xianyun was good friends with Guizhong and shared a similar like of mechanics; following her death in the Archon War, she modified the Guizhong Ballista to honor her memory. She is competitive and prideful, generally starting competitions over fairly trivial matters, such as cooking and racing. She also shows a caring side to her disciples; she made a special pinwheel device for Ganyu after noticing she was interested in some being sold at a stall, and was pleased to see her enjoy it. When she is with Ganyu, she generally has a habit of reminiscing about her past, much to Ganyu's embarrassment. Likewise, she was curious about how Shenhe was doing in human society and was pleased to she had no issues.

        Xianyun is a tall woman with long, navy hair that has light blue undertones. Her hair is tied in a high ponytail secured with a hairpin that resembles the sharpness of a crane. She has shorter eyebrows and wears red glasses. Although Xianyun seems to take the form of a human, she has taloned fingers, like the claws of a crane. Her outfit is flowy and dress-like with many white, greens, blues, and yellows, and she adorns many pendants. She wears high heels and seems to be fond of accessories.
        In her crane form, she is taller than many humans and is white with blue, gold, and black plumage. Under her eyes are red markings.

            <span>Normal Attack
Summons swirling winds to perform up to 4 attacks, dealing Anemo DMG.

Charged Attack
Consumes a certain amount of Stamina and launches a Breeze Bolt in a straight line that deals Anemo DMG to opponents along its path.

Plunging Attack
Gathers the power of Anemo and plunges towards the ground from mid-air, damaging all opponents in her path. Deals AoE Anemo DMG upon impact with the ground.

            <span>Xianyun enters the Cloud Transmogrification state, in which she will not take Fall DMG, and uses Skyladder once.
In this state, her Plunging Attack will be converted into Driftcloud Wave instead, which deals AoE Anemo DMG and ends the Cloud Transmogrification state. This DMG is considered Plunging Attack DMG.
Each use of Skyladder while in this state increases the DMG and AoE of the next Driftcloud Wave used.

Skyladder
Can be used while in mid-air. Xianyun leaps forward, dealing Anemo DMG to targets along her path.
During each Cloud Transmogrification state Xianyun enters, Skyladder may be used up to 3 times and only 1 instance of Skyladder DMG can be dealt to any one opponent.
If Skyladder is not used again in a short period, the Cloud Transmogrification state will be canceled.

If Xianyun does not use Driftcloud Wave while in this state, the next CD of White Clouds at Dawn will be decreased by 3s.</span>

            <span>Brings forth a sacred breeze that deals AoE Anemo DMG and heals all nearby characters based on Xianyun's ATK. It will also summon the "Starwicker" mechanism.

Starwicker 

Continuously follows the active character and periodically heals all nearby party members based on Xianyun's ATK.
Starts with 8 stacks of Adeptal Assistance. While Adeptal Assistance is active, nearby active characters in the party will have their jump height increased.
When the active character completes a Plunging Attack, Starwicker will consume 1 stack of Adeptal Assistance and deal AoE Anemo DMG.

Only 1 Starwicker can exist simultaneously.
