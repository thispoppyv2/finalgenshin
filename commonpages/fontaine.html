            Of the regions of Teyvat, Fontaine prides itself as the hub of culture and the arts; or in the words of Francis, a traveling merchant from the region, "true beauty and elegance." The newspaper The Steambird is the main newspaper of the Court of Fontaine; Mona is a columnist on it, suggesting that they have writers from all across Teyvat. According to the Steambird, Fontaine is located in the center of Teyvat[3] and is the source of all waters on the continent. Its entire continental plate is elevated, making it significantly higher than other nations. At the edge of Fontaine is a massive waterfall that stretches for thousands of meters.

            Fontaine boasts its immersion in the development of technology, as referenced in multiple story points — such as the Mikage Furnace, designed by Fontaine engineers, including Xavier; and limited events — such as in Fabulous Fungus Frenzy, where the Wisdom Orb is a Fontaine-local-designed equipment designed to suppress specific behaviors in organisms.

            Minor events that have featured Fontaine's technologic prowess include Core of the Apparatus, which features Fontainian inventions that can manufacture toys and furnishings, and Evermotion Mechanical Painting, which features mechanical gear systems.

            There is a special energy system in Fontaine; however, it is mentioned to be on the verge of declining, causing many people to seek alternative sources.[4] Additionally, Santon states that the air in Fontaine is "practically toxic fumes" and that there is much less connection to nature there, though he is not necessarily referring to the entire region.[5]

            According to Vasco, a diving certificate can be obtained in Fontaine, and diving itself is an important profession in the nation.

            Liben had described Fontaine's locals as believing that some type of "judgment" was "soon to come," possibly in reference to the prophecy described in the Archon Quests about the nation being destroyed by rising sea levels to absolve its people of their "sin."

            The Fontaine Research Institute is located in Fontaine, though its original main buildings were destroyed in an experiment conducted by Edwin Eastinghouse.

            Other races also reside in Fontaine, such as the Melusine and, once upon a time, the Oceanids.
