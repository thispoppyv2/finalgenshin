        <p class="content-wrapper">Inazuma is a region in Genshin Impact that is located southeast of Liyue Harbor and is close to the Dark Sea. It is the third nation in the game, and is only accessible after the player completes the Liyue storyline. Before then, the region is surrounded by a strong thunderstorm, making it inaccessible by land. 

            To get to Inazuma, the player must be Adventure Rank 30 and start Chapter 1 of the "The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia" Inazuma Archon Quest. The player should complete up to at least the "Ritou Escape Plan" part of this Archon Quest, as they can't leave Ritou and explore the rest of Inazuma until they do so. 

            Inazuma is an archipelagic region that is based on Japan's culture. It has a diverse cultural makeup, and is divided into three main factions: Narukami Island, Kannazuka, and Yashiori Island. Inazuma City is located on Narukami Island, and cherry blossoms are planted all over the island. 

            Inazuma is the region of eternity, and worships Baal, the Electro Archon. The Inazuma Shogunate is the governing body of Inazuma, and worships Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon and God of Eternity. 
            Inazuma is filled with Japanese-inspired scenery and architecture, and has a great soundtrack. It is also home to lots of new mobs, and mysteries are all over the land. 

            Inazuma is based on Japan, and eternity is a fundamental belief in Shinto, the native religion of Japanese people. Inazuma is different from all the other nations, because it doesn't adapt. The concept of eternity is to never change. Growth and change are as much of a blessing as they are a curse. 

            Inazuma also has the following factions: Tenryou Commission, Arataki Gang, Yashiro Commission, Kanjou Commission.
