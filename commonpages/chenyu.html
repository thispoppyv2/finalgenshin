        <p class="content-wrapper">Chenyu Vale refers to the area surrounding Mt. Yaojun, a sacred mountain which was once under the dominion of an adeptus known as the "Herblord," who once took the form of a young lady. While Chenyu Vale is described as having "many mountains [and] rivers" in Flowing Rings' description, Jade Leaf's description only mentions a single river; regardless, this water source is likely the reason why Chenyu Vale's climate is "relatively humid" compared to the Hills of Barsom.

            According to legend, the Herblord's friend, another adeptus, planted a particular tea tree here. When the tree was still a sapling, someone tied a jade ornament to it; later on, when the Herblord returned to the mountains in a changed form, she no longer had the fingers to untie this ornament, while her friend had sunk to the bottom of the ocean.[1] Many years after, the tree's branches were grafted to the "other side of the river" by people who lived on the mountain, and its tea leaves became famous in Liyue Harbor and other areas. However, this type of tea tree is said to only grow well in Chenyu Vale because it remembers the promise between two friends.

            There is another legend that claims the Herblord's adeptal form turned into the branches of an ancient tea tree, and one in which the Herblord ascended to an "adeptal mountain."These legends currently cannot be verified, although the former appears to be a more fantastical interpretation of the tea tree legend mentioned in the previous paragraph.

            In reality, during the Archon War, an unnamed god ruled over Chenyu Vale and was at war with Morax; the Herblord and the other adeptus, known as Fujin, served under the unnamed god. The war was incredibly bloody, as the Bishui River was crimson red from all the fighting between the two cations. The people who lived there at the time did not participate in the war, so to protect them, Fujin and the Herblord created sanctuaries to protect them from the god's other followers. Near the end of the war, in a final attempt to defeat Morax, the god planned to flood the Bishui River, which would also destroy the vale. Seeing this, the Herblord and Fujin rebelled against their god. The Herblord fought the god, Lingyuan evacuated the people and Fujin threw the Votive Rainjade into the waters. The Herblord was greatly diminished after fighting the god, while Fujin lost many of her powers and "sank into the sea," losing much of her strength.
